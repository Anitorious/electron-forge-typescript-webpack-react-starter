# electron-forge-typescript-webpack-react-starter

It's as simple as it sounds! This is a template repository as a quick start to rolling your own electron powered react application. Includes HMR capabilities
for your development environment.

This template includes `styled-components` by default, but feel free to replace it with your preferred JS-in-CSS solution or remove it all-together. The default 
webpack configuration handles CSS bundling and can be extended to compile SASS or LESS as desired.

All you need to do to start building is run;

`yarn`

to install required dependancies and;

`yarn start`

to start the electron development server.
